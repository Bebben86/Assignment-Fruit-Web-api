# Assignment-Fruit-web-api
Assignment in web developement class. The assigment is to create an api with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints. 

The API has a simple SQLite-database with two tables; Fruits and Categories, and the tables are connected with ForeignKey CategoryId.

Categories endpoints are managed by string categoryName, mostly to prove a point, while fruits endpoint are mostly handled by the more traditionally used Id.
